Week 1 AICTE Edunet Internship – Lung Cancer Detection dataset and problem statement

# Lung Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of lung cancer using health and lifestyle factors.  
Developed as part of the **AICTE–Edunet Week 1 Internship** milestone.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and is often detected at advanced stages.  
This project uses machine learning to predict lung cancer risk based on parameters such as age, gender, smoking habits, anxiety, and chest pain.

## 💡 Need of the Project
- Early detection improves survival rates and reduces medical costs.  
- AI-based prediction supports doctors in diagnosis.  
- Encourages public health awareness through data-driven insights.  
- Demonstrates the potential of ML in healthcare applications.
